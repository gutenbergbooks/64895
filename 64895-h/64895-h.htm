<p>GENTLEMEN,</p>

<p><i>While I was extracting the following
sheets from my voluminous Journal, and connecting
them together as accurately as I was
able, in order to present the Public with a
Specimen of my laborious investigation of the
present state of</i> <span class="smcap">Music</span> <i>in this my native
country, I was somewhat at a loss to whom
I could with most propriety inscribe my work.
Whether to</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor Burney</span><i>, as the original
inventor of this species of composition,
and the first musical traveller of our nation,
to whom I stand so much indebted for the
plan, and conduct of my book, and of whom
I might truly say in his own words, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
he has long been my</i> magnus Apollo<i>:”—or
whether I was in duty bound to pay homage
to the King of</i> Prussia<i>, as the greatest</i> Dilettante
<i>performer of the age; who, I suppose,
at this present writing, like another</i>
Nero<i>, is playing his new</i> Solfeggi <i>to the
dying groans of the obstinate</i> Dantziggers<i>;—or
whether I ought not to call forth from
his obscurity that venerable Judge, who
contented with less ambitious pleasures, cultivates
the fine arts by humbler and modester,
but not less curious experiments, and amuses
the leisure hours of a long vacation in</i> caponizing
blackbirds<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><i>; or whether I should
not do well to express my gratitude, and that
of the nation, to the honourable Directors
of our Opera, for having at last condescended
to permit an</i> Englishwoman <i>to be called</i>
Signora<i>, and by virtue of that title to share
some of the princely incomes which have been
hitherto lavished on</i> Italians<i>, and which, I
dare say, those worthy Noblemen and Gentlemen
would as readily bestow upon</i> English<span class="allsmcap">MEN</span><i>,
if they would but consent to be properly</i>
qualified. <i>This dilemma, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
was at an end, as soon as I learnt, that
Dr.</i> Burney<i>, and Signor</i> Giardini<i>, had,
under your authority, just founded a school
for music (in imitation, I suppose, of the
Italian</i> Conservatorios<i>) in the</i> <span class="smcap">Foundling
Hospital</span><i>, where about an hundred of
such poor children, as have hitherto been placed
out to trades and services, in which they had
no opportunity of making</i> a noise <i>in the world,
are, in future, to be trained to harmony from
their infancy, and constantly employed in
the study of music; ’till in process of time they
take their regular degrees as</i> Doctors<i>, and</i>
Doctoresses <i>of music, and come forth, sufficiently
accomplished (as they must be under such
masters,) to form the national taste, by the
true</i> Italian <i>standard. When I was informed
of this event, I hailed the happy omen, the
dawn of an</i> Augustan æra<i>; and resolved to
offer my tribute of congratulation and applause,
and to dedicate this work to a set of
gentlemen, who have so distinguished their zeal
for the interest and advancement of music.
Perhaps it will at first appear a bold
undertaking in the guardians of deserted
orphans, chiefly supported by parliamentary
grants of public money, to declare, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
cannot be maintained by the public for a
more useful purpose, than to be taught to
sing and play</i> Italian <i>airs. For men of
narrow and contrasted minds, who have
neither</i> ear<i>, nor</i> voice<i>, nor</i> hand<i>, will still
imagine, that it might prove of more national
utility, to breed these adopted children
of the public, to Husbandry, Navigation, &amp;c.
the objects of their original destination; than
to convert one of the noblest of our public charities
into a nursery for the supply of musical
performers at our Theatres, gardens, and
hops.—But this is a vulgar prejudice. The
improvement of the fine arts ought to be the
first object of public attention in an age of
luxury,</i> <span class="allsmcap">PEACE</span><i>, and plenty, like the present;
when we have rivalled the</i> Italians <i>in music,
it will be time enough to think of our navy,
and our agriculture. We have already (to
our shame be it spoken,) better sailors than
fiddlers, and more farmers than</i> contrapuntists<i>.
But as I take this circumstance to arise entirely
from the different degree of encouragement
those occupations have hitherto received;
I do not despair of seeing the reverse take
place, when gentlemen of your rank deign
to stand forward, and correct the errors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
the public, by the influence and sanction of
your example. Should any obstacles arise
to impede the immediate execution of your
plan, from some obsolete but unrepealed
parliamentary restrictions, doubtless the same
legislators who so readily expended the
public money in the purchase of Sir</i> William
Hamilton<i>’s</i> collection <i>of antique vases, and</i>
Etruscan <i>rarities, will not only repeal any
former act which may stand in your way;
but rejoice in a fresh opportunity of displaying
their fine taste and love of the
arts, by laying an additional tax upon
such of the necessaries of life as are not
already overloaded, in order to raise a competent
sum for the purchase of the best</i> Cremonas<i>,
and other instruments which can be
procured on the continent, for the service
of your</i> Academia<i>. I have only to add,
gentlemen, that if upon a perusal of the
following sheets you shall find, as I am persuaded
you will, that my travels are also<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in
some measure, a matter of national concern;
I hope you will be kind enough to
second my intended application to parlia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>ment,
that the charges of my future expeditions
may be defrayed at the public
expence. This, gentlemen, may be done by
a very short clause; and as it will enable
me to pursue my enquiries with spirit, credit,
and success, will lay a lasting obligation
upon,</i></p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I was</span> born in the Parish of <i>Gotham</i>,
in the county of <i>Nottingham</i>: my father
was a sawyer, and my mother had, for
many years before her marriage, cried
oysters and Newcastle-salmon about the
streets of London. Neither of them are
said to have been remarkable for their
vocal or instrumental talents. My mother’s
voice was, indeed, exceedingly shrill and
dissonant, as I have been credibly informed
by the neighbours; however, I
was no sooner born than I gave proofs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
uncommon musical propensities. I entered
the world, singing, instead of crying; at
least, my squall was truly melodious, and
ravished the ears of the midwife; tho’,
I must confess, the envious old hag of a
nurse did pretend that my mother and
Mrs. <i>Midnight</i> mistook the origin of the
wild notes I uttered as soon as I saw
the light; and, insisting that they only
denoted the wind-cholic, immediately
drenched me with a large dose of rhubarb:
however, she has candidly confessed, that
she easily sang me to sleep whenever I
was peevish, and that even by means of
such simple melody as <i>Jack Sprat</i>, or <i>hey
diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle</i>. A
harsh and menacing recitative would as
effectually deter me from a naughty trick,
as a good whipping. The sound of a
drum, or any other martial music, had
such an immediate effect upon my nerves,
that I was always obliged to be turned
dry before the piece was half over. The
famous <i>March in Saul</i> is too powerful for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
me even at this day, tho’ I can stand any
other, without being offensive. Indeed,
I am so well convinced of the connection
between the sound and the sense in all
good music, that I will venture to prescribe
<i>Handel’s water-piece</i>, and <i>water
parted from the sea</i>, as specifics for a
strangury. I know that there is great
truth in what <i>Shakespear</i> says of the bag-pipe;
and I have observed that a jockey
always whistles to his horse upon these
occasions, which never fails to produce
great effects, tho’ the performer want
brilliancy of execution ever so much.</p>

<p>One of the first circumstances I myself
can recollect in my early years, was the
great pleasure I took in hearing a blind
boy play tunes on a bladder of air press’d
between a bow-stick and its string. The
Jew’s-harp next engaged my attention;
and afterwards the bag-pipe and bassoon.
Indeed I do remember having been told
by my Grandmother, that whilst I was
yet in coats, I took vast delight in pinching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
the tails of the Parson’s litter of pigs, and
would listen to their various notes and
tones from the <i>f</i> sharp of the whine of the
least of the family, quite down to the <i>b</i> flat
of the boar himself. This, with my
attention to my coral and bells, and
rattle, singing thro’ a comb and brown
paper, together with the great expertness
I afterwards shew’d in making whistles of
reeds, and the recent bark of sycamore
twigs, made the oldest people of the parish
foretel, that I should one day or other
become a great and celebrated Musician.</p>

<p>My taste for the sister art of music,
Poetry, was likewise, as I am inform’d,
observed very early in my childhood; as
I always held my mouth wide open, when
the Psalm was sang at our Parish-Church;
and soon was able to repeat without book
a great part of <i>Sternhold</i> and <i>Hopkins</i>’s
excellent version of that great Dilettanti
performer on the harp, King <i>David</i>’s pieces.</p>

<p>Having been well inform’d that the
infancy, and indeed the riper years of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
great Mus. D. or musical Doctor (whom
I call, <i>par excellence</i>, <span class="smcap">Dr. Mus</span>) passed in
much the same manner, and with similar
expectations from all the old ladies of his
acquaintance; and having observed with
what <i>eclat</i>, and indeed universal approbation
of all people of taste, his ingenious
account of his ingenious travels has been
received, I conceived a design of following
so illustrious an example, and travelling
through the dominions of <i>England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>
and <i>Ireland</i>, with the town of
<i>Berwick</i> upon <i>Tweed</i>, to give a true
state of the musical improvement and
progression in these kingdoms; and hope I
may flatter myself, that the Dr. himself will
applaud my undertaking, and consider it as
a proper supplement to his elaborate work.</p>

<p>Before I set forwards on my travels, I
chose to change my name from <i>Collier</i> to
<i>Coglioni</i> or <i>Collioni</i>, as more euphonious;
and on the first of April, having torn
myself from the arms of my weeping
wife, and four small children, I put my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
bassoon into a green-bag, and slung it
across my shoulders; my large violoncello
was laid on my knee as I sat in the
waggon, and my clothes, with a bottle of
brandy and some biscuits, were pack’d up
in the viol-case. As I was neither patronized,
nor franked on my tour by any
Dilettanti Lord, I must confess the low
state of my circumstances, and the poverty
in which I had left my family, cast a damp
on my spirits; but this was always soon
dissipated by an air on the violoncello,
and by recollecting the great advantages
my travels, to enquire into the state of
music in this island, would be to my
dear native country, and the fame and
glory I should acquire by the publication
of my work, perhaps only inferior to
that of the great Dr. <i>Mus</i> himself.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> occasionally consoling myself,
the waggon arrived at the famous
and ancient city of <i>Lincoln</i>. My first visit
was to a young lady of high musical acquirements.
She received me with a most
bewitching air, which she sang to her guittar,
for she had heard of my fame at <i>Gotham</i>,
and was not unapprized of my ambulatory
design: her name was originally <i>Fernihough</i>,
but she had long dropped the
<i>hough</i> at the end of it, as gothic and
inharmonious. Thus she saluted me:</p>

<p>“Dear Collioni, Collioni, Collioni;</p>
<p>Dear, dear, dear, Collioni;</p>
<p>Happy, happy, Gotham, Gotham;</p>
<p>Gotham, Gotham, happy Gotham.”</p>

<p>I could only bow and smile in answer
to this compliment, (which indeed, tho’
very elegant, I did not conceive was above
my merits,) as I had not an extempore
sonnet ready made to answer it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Then taking my hand with a delightful
air, she introduced me to Dr. <i>Dilettanti</i>,
a most illustrious timeist; he sat musing
and beating with his foot, and took hold
of, and quitted my hand in the same
portion of time, which he measured by
the pulsations of his foot.</p>

<p>“Excuse,” said he, “illustrious <i>Collioni</i>,
the measured mode of my gestures in
saluting you; but I have long accustomed
myself to measure out the parts
of time on a variety of sounding instruments,
and have at length introduced it
into all the motions of my body. At
my house, sir, you will learn to cut your
meat, and move your jaws at dinner in
common or triple time, according to
the instruments that accompany our
meals.——By dealing the cards at quadrille,
how easy it is to judge if the
party has an ear!——yonder gentleman
who comes towards our window, see how
he swings his arms in exact time, true as
the pendulum of a clock. I can assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
you, sir, he is great on the violoncello.
My dear wife says, the conjugal endearments
are doubly improved, if a husband
is a good timeist. She approves of
triple time; and on this account I formerly
had a servant who play’d in our
bed-room every Sunday night, ’till we
slept. And since I became one of the
<i>castrati</i>, I have acquired the habit of
making water at intervals in the truest
time like a pig; and may say, that I
believe for exactness of ear, that I am
not exceeded by any modern musician.”</p>

<p>On this, this great man took up a Jew’s
harp that lay by him, and with a twing,
twang, twong, moving his finger across
his lips, and making faces in the most
exact time, he fetched out such prurient
harmony, as ravished my very soul, and
threw sweet Miss <i>Ferni</i> into the most
agreeable convulsions.</p>

<p>During our dinner, two of the Doctor’s
servants entertained us with many excellent
and solemn pieces of music. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
I was so solicitous to cut and eat my meat
in true time, as I thought my character
depended on this circumstance, that I
unfortunately cut my lips, so that the
blood much terrified me; and sweet Miss
<i>Ferni</i> was so earnestly attending to the
fiddlers, that on their suddenly changing
the time from <i>adagio</i> to <i>sestina</i>, she swallowed
the ivory spoon out of a mustard
pot; which, as it stuck across her throat, I
am sure must have given that excellent
young lady exquisite pain, yet did she
cough, and even vomit repeatedly in most
accurate time, and screamed from fear
most harmoniously through the whole
gamut, from <i>a</i> to <i>g</i> inclusively, long
after the spoon was restored to its place.</p>

me a present of a place in the stage
coach to <i>Sheffield</i> in my road to <i>York</i>, that
I might inquire into the present state of
the music of that city and cathedral.
Amongst the other passengers, was a gentleman
of a grave aspect; who, from his
not attending to me at the inn, when I
play’d a most inchanting solo on my
hautboy, appear’d at first to have no ears,
but on further conversation I found him a
most agreeable companion. He cry’d up
the ingenuity of the <i>Sheffield</i> manufacturers,
and told me of a new musical
instrument, more complicate, he thought,
and louder than an organ. The next day
he was so good as to accompany me to
hear this new organic instrument. The
first thing I could observe was a number
of iron pipes, and a water wheel to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the large bellows, like that organ of
which there is a print in <i>Kempleri Musurgia</i>.
When the wheel was in motion,
I observed many of the notes higher than
in any organ I had ever heard; and was
told, that these ingenious people had
found the only way to produce these was,
by boring gun-barrels: to these a symphony
was adduced by files which cut
the teeth of large saws, and the mellow
tones of two great hammers, which at
intervals struck on large pieces of red-hot
iron, made a more tremendous and affecting
concert, than all the mingled
whittles of <i>Cecilia</i>’s organ.</p>

<p>Having paid a shilling to the performers
of this stupendous piece of harmony, at
which my grave companion seem’d much
delighted, and listen’d to my remarks
upon it with the greatest avidity and
approbation; “Signior <i>Collioni</i>,” says he,
“your observations inchant me; the most
antient music, as you well explain, was
made with hammers beating upon anvils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
as invented by <i>Tubal Cain</i>, and
practised in the shop of his successor,
<i>Vulcan</i>, tho’ <i>Saturn</i> is thought to have
been the first of the <i>castrati</i>.—But this
invention was not compleat, Signior
<i>Collioni</i>, it was not compleat, till this
excellent treble made by boring guns,
and cutting saws was added.—It is now
become the true antient, celebrated,
long-lost, and long-deplored chromatic,
which that <i>Heathen</i>, <i>Plato</i>, who had
doubtless ass’s ears, expelled from his
artificial commonwealth.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless you are right in your conjectures,”
reply’d I, “Mr. <i>Hummings</i>,
(for that was my kind companion’s
name) it was music like this, which
could disenchant the moon, and make
trees and stones dance <i>allemands</i>.
Would you believe it, Mr. <i>Hummings</i>,
I once cured a girl bit with a tarantula
myself with this simple bassoon?</p>

<p>“<i>Trut, turrut, phub, phub, bush!</i>—This
was the air, Mr. <i>Hummings</i>, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
shall hear it——<i>trut, turrut, phub, phub,
bush</i>:—the girl rising from her melancholy
attitude, danced till the sweat
ran down to the hem of her scarlet
petticoat; and after I had presented her
with a bit of money, became so lively
as to strip herself like King <i>David</i>, and
danced like a <i>Heinel</i>. I can assure you,
Mr. <i>Hummings</i>, I drove away the evil
spirit, and cured her of her tarantulism
that night.</p>

<p>“Not unlike this, is a fact recorded
by the divine <i>Homer</i>. <i>Ulysses</i> had a
large rent made in his thigh by a wild
boar,—a terrible animal, Mr. <i>Hummings</i>:—well,
and what happen’d?—why,
he only sent for the town-waits,
and after the first bar or two were
play’d, the blood stopp’d; and as the
fiddles proceeded, the wound contracted,
and by the time they had
finished <i>Alley Croaker</i>, <i>Moggy Lauder</i>,
and <i>A lovely Lass to a Fryar came</i>, (which
are all antient <i>Greek</i> tunes, sir,) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
wound was quite healed, and the
cicatrix as smooth as the back of my
hand.”</p>

<p>During this conversation, an unfortunate
accident had happened near us. One of
the performers on the hammer and iron
by a fall had broken his leg. A surgeon
was sent for with all dispatch, but Mr.
<i>Hummings</i> said I had as well try the effect
of the bassoon upon him; and pointing
to me, told the people that they need
seek no farther, for I was superior to any
surgeon. Upon this, untying my green
bag, the man cry’d out, he begg’d no
instruments might be used. “No, (says
I,) none but a musical instrument.” So
I began with a gentle blast, and played
and sung alternately,—“<i>You’ll ne’er go
the sooner to the Stygian Ferry. Let not
your noble spirits be cast down, but drink,
drink, drink, and be merry.</i>”—“Give
me some ale, (cries the wounded man)
I like this, Doctor.” Afterward I blew
till I nearly had burst my cheeks, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
then sung, <i>If ’tis joy to wound a lover</i>; but
the bone would not knit:—indeed I could
not make it knit at all—and I don’t believe,
as Mr. <i>Hummings</i> said, that if Dr. <i>Mus</i>
himself, and all the musicians of Britain,
fiddlers, violoncellos, double violoncellos,
trumpets, and trumpet-marinos, together
with every <i>Maestro di Capella</i> in <i>Italy</i>
had been present, they could have made
this bone knit—which, I suppose, was
owing to the scorbutic habit of body of
the patient; indeed, Mr. <i>Hummings</i> attributed
it entirely to this cause; for the
blood stopped before I had finished the
first song.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> worth remark occur’d
in my journey from hence to <i>York</i>;
but at my approach to this celebrated city,
my heart leapt for joy as soon as I beheld
the towers of the cathedral; here, says I,
I shall be much caressed and followed, I
dare believe, as there are so many of the
<i>Dilettanti</i> who reside within the precincts of
this antient seat of music and superstition.
This letter, says I, is of inestimable value,
taking it from my pocket, and reading
the direction, “For that incomparable
Musician and Antiquarian, Dr. <i>Hiccup</i>;”
doubtless he will pay great attention to
his friends at <i>Lincoln</i>, who have honoured
me with it. The footman shewed me
into an elegant parlour, where there was
a clock with chimes, so contrived that
St. <i>Peter</i>, St. <i>Paul</i>, and the <i>Virgin Mary</i>
were seen striking alternately on the bells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
and by a sweet trio announced every hour
of the day. Dr. <i>Hiccup</i> was, it seems,
at his devotions, which he always performed
in imitation of that great and
devout musician, King <i>David</i>. He was a
tall, boney figure, with a swarthy complexion,
and blear eyes. As I sat down
he took no notice of me, but continued
dancing with a harp in his hand, without
his breeches, and with his night-gown
and shirt tucked up above his waist; and
as he turned his brown posteriors this
way and that, in the gyrations of the
dance, all the women and children that
were looking in through the window of
his parlour, giggled, and made faces, and
shewed variety of indecent gesticulations
and noises. None of these, however, interrupted
the devotions of this great man.</p>

<p>Never were such charming tunes elicited
from mortal harp, <i>Cambrian</i> or <i>Eolic!</i>
the dance was Devotion itself in human
form! After a little refreshment, this illustrious
Musician condescended to enter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>tain
me with several interesting particulars
of the manner of his life, which I
begg’d leave to copy in my pocket book
in his presence.</p>

<p>He rose every morning, when his
chime-clock struck eleven, (for, like the
famous <i>Chevalier Gluck</i>, he is too great
a genius to rise early) and generally gaped
all the time his lady was putting on his
breeches. For breakfast he always eat
rolls and butter, whether in summer or
winter; and after his breakfast paid a visit
to <i>Cloacina</i>, but assured me he never used
old music books on this occasion on any
account. He retired to rest about ten,
and seldom fail’d once in a month to compliment
his lady for undressing him.</p>

<p>He communicated many other particulars
to me of less moment, and was so
obliging at length to beg I would treat
him with an air or two on the bassoon.</p>

<p>I thought this a good opportunity to
give him a specimen of my poetic talents,
as well as of my musical ones, and per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>formed
the following song, which I composed
at <i>Gotham</i> several years ago.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some came in a waggon, and some in a cart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many there were that did nothing but f—t:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh rare <i>Nottingham</i> town, <i>Nottingham</i> town!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Nottingham</i> town; Oh rare <i>Nottingham</i> town!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sweetness of the notes on my
bassoon, an instrument whose tone is so
like the sound it was to represent, ravished
his ears, which he hung quite down on
each shoulder, during the whole time of
my performance.</p>

<p>I slept this night at Dr. <i>Hiccup</i>’s house,
and borrowed a shirt and pair of stockings
of him. At breakfast I took an opportunity
to tell him of the narrowness of
my circumstances; but he was suddenly
taken with a rapturous fit of devotion,
and pulling up his night-gown to his waist,
began to sing, and dance, and caper, and
kick, to such a degree, that no one in
the room was safe: I ran towards the door
to save my shins, and the Doctor rising
with both feet in the air like a Harlequin,
gave me such a horse-kick on my rump,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
singing at the same time the <i>March in Saul</i>,
that I descended into the street down five
steps, head foremost, and cracked my
bassoon in twenty places.</p>

<p>Six hours I attended at the door, but was
told by a servant out of a window, that
the Doctor was still performing his dance
of devotion; and for aught I know, that
great man may dance till doom’s-day, as
I never after could get any other answer at
his door.</p>

<p>On more mature reflexion, I thought
this kind of treatment very hard from a
brother musician, and one to whom I was
so well recommended; but I consoled
myself with considering, that though my
bassoon was broken in sundry places, yet
I had retained the Doctor’s shirt and
stockings; and that it was very likely my
great prototype, Dr. Mus himself, had
frequently met with the same treatment,
tho’ his modesty had inclined him
to conceal it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DURHAM">DURHAM.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> this place to <i>Durham</i> I
was necessitated to travel on foot;
and by playing the <i>Black Joke</i>, <i>Murdoch
O’Blaney</i>, and other sentimental tunes
to the girls of the villages I pass’d through,
procured food and lodging, which my
brother of the String had refused me.
At <i>Darlington</i>, I waited on the <i>Maestro di
Capella</i>, or clerk of the parish, who I
may assert had the finest nasality, or nose-intonation,
that ever was given to <i>David</i>’s
<i>psalms</i>; and the melody of his <i>Amen</i>,
was quite astonishing.</p>

<p>So well was my bassoon received at this
church, that the ’Squire’s lady invited me
to Dinner. “Good Signior <i>Collioni</i>,” says
she, “you have charmed, you have enraptured
me; pray, has the wind which
escapes out at the end of your instrument
any smell?”——“smell!” says I, “no,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
madam, not unless I eat onions.” At
this all the ladies laughed most extravagantly.</p>

<p>However, the ’Squire after dinner gave
me a recommendatory letter to the great
Mr. <i>Eccho</i> of <i>Durham</i>, principal performer
belonging to that opulent cathedral; and
withal told me, that Mr. <i>Eccho</i> had so
long apply’d himself to musical notes,
that he had utterly forgot all articulate
language. That he preached, conversed,
prayed, scolded, swore, talk’d bawdy,
and blasphemy, all on the fiddle, without
uttering a word, or even making a sign
with his fingers.</p>

<p>At my introduction to this great man,
I began a long complimental speech,
which I had been some time studying.——“Most
respectable sir, whose soul is a
soul of harmony, and whose body is
like a base-viol.”——Here he snatch’d
up his fiddle with an air of great complacency,
and drawing, the bow gently
over the strings said, as plain as if he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
spoke it. “Oh, sir, your most obedient;
you compliment me indeed, sir, too
much.” I then told him how long a
journey I had performed on foot, and that
the dusty roads had made me dry. He
snatched up his violin, and before he had
play’d above a bar or two, in came a footman
with a jug of delicate ale. Next I
mentioned modestly my having eat nothing
all day.——“<i>Trut, trut, bish, bash, bush</i>,”
cries the fiddle—“Indeed, sir,” replies I, “I,
don’t fast for the sake of devotion”——“<i>ir,
er, ar, querr, quorr, quurr</i>”—quoth
the fiddle, and in came a surloin of cold
beef, and mustard and bread, in the
twinkling of a fiddle-stick.</p>

<p>This gentleman, quoth I, is greater
than <i>Orpheus</i> or <i>Eurydice</i>, or the <i>Serpent</i>;—no,
no, <i>Orpheus</i> could do no such
things as these—ale and beef were a note
or two above his fiddle!</p>

<p>Soon after came in Mr. <i>Eccho</i>’s wife,
with a “what the deuce are you about,
bringing beggars into my house?”—Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
<i>Eccho</i> catched up the fiddle, and such a
jar did I never hear “<i>arg, erg, urg, gir,
gor, gur</i>”—I warrant you madam became
as dumb as if she were inchanted.</p>

<p>Indeed, hearing this lady give me the
opprobrious name of beggar, I took care
to shew the diamond ring on my little
finger, which I always wear when I perform
in public, which might give her a
better opinion of me, tho’ indeed it is
only a Bristol stone, and that I pay a
silver-smith two pence a week for the use
of; and I would have hired a laced
waistcoat, but was asked a shilling a
week, tho’ I am sure the lace had been
twice turn’d; yet, if I had hired it, I
dare say Dr. <i>Hiccup</i> would scarcely have
kicked me out of his house.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> <i>Carlisle</i> I waited on Lord <i>Diddle-doodle</i>
with proper musical credentials:
he was sat against a glass
practising some solfeggis on the violin,
and attending to the gracefulness of his
own attitude. “Most illustrious Peer,”
says I, (making a bow to the very
ground) “your noble ancestors gain’d
victory in the hardy fields of war, but
you by music civilize and harmonize
mankind; with what rapture must they
lean from their starry mansions to see
and hear your immortal powers of harmony
and grace!” I stopp’d, and on
looking up, found that his lordship had
not attended to a word I had spoken, nor
seemed conscious of my being in the
room;—but as great geniuses are often
absent, I repeated my compliment in
a louder voice, and approaching, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
amazed to find that his lordship was quite
deaf, deaf as a post; and yet he executed
the most difficult passages in music with
the greatest grace and manner, better,
I dare say, than if he had heard his
own performance.</p>

<p>When his lordship had perceived me,
he approached me with the utmost politeness,
and made signs for me to sit down,
and accompany him upon the bassoon,
which I did ’till dinner-time. After dinner,
I intreated my lady <i>Diddle-doodle</i> to
prevail upon the noble lord to sing, which
he did; but I was rather disappointed at
finding that his voice was only pack-thread<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
However, he sung in tune;
had a shake, and was far from vulgar.
My lady afterwards made ample amends
by her own singing. Her voice was a
skane of silk, without the least mixture of
worsted. She understood all the lights
and shades of melody. Her back-ground;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
her mezzotints; and her clare-obscure
were charming, and there was such a
roundness and dignity in all the tones,
that every thing she did became interesting.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It was in this part of <i>England</i>, I paid
a visit to Mr. <i>Quaver</i>, with recommendatory
letters from lord <i>Diddle-doodle</i>; I
found him to be a gentleman of considerable
and original musical genius; his taste
was pure, chaste, refined; and his execution,
particularly upon the Jew’s harp,
was exquisite; he executed with great
taste and powers, <i>Nancy Dawson</i>, <i>Lillabullero</i>,
and <i>Old Sir Simon the king</i>. After
dinner he explained to me his system for
the improvement of sound, which was at
once sublime and original. “The Author
of Nature,” said he, “has with an equal
and judicious hand distributed his gifts
among his creatures: to one he has given
strength; to another, dexterity; to a third,
perseverance; in the same manner has he
divided the agreeable qualifications; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the courtier and the fine gentleman need
not blush to receive instruction from the
spaniel and the monkey—Now as the
philosopher models his life upon an imitation
of the virtues of animals, the true
connoisseur will do the same”—there he
stopp’d, as if afraid to explain himself; but
I told him, that there was something so
original and masterly in his conceptions
that I should never be easy, until he communicated
them. Upon which, after a
short pause, he seized me by the hand,
and grasping it with affection, “since,”
said he, “I find in you the true spirit of
your science, I will no longer maintain
any reserve; know then, that after a
profound meditation upon the sublimest
mysteries of our profession, I have traced
them up to the creation”—“how!” said
I, with amaze, “I thought that the greatest
Antiquarians had never brought them
with any certainty higher than the Deluge.”
“I knew,” said he, “I should surprize
you; but it is certain that <i>Adam</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
amongst his other qualifications, possessed
that of expressing every sound that ever
has or can be uttered; hence he could not
only sing base and treble, counter-tenor,
and soprano to admiration; but also
squeak like a pig, croak like a frog, bellow
like a bull, whinny like a colt, and
bray like an ass.”</p>

<p>“It is true, that the greater part of these
faculties was taken from him at the Fall,
and have been very sparingly bestowed
upon his descendants; from hence arises
that degeneracy into which music has
fallen in the modern ages of the world:
that sublime science, instead of expressing
the natural passions, by a judicious imitation
of the tones of beasts; instead of
roaring out the lion’s rage; bellowing the
jealousy of the bull, or chanting the amorous
passions of the nightingale, is become
a meer unmeaning jargon, without force
or energy, and its professors and admirers
are dwindled into the most contemptible
part of the creation; quavering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
eunuchs, unfeeling prostitutes, insignificant
blockheads, wretches without head,
or heart, or sentiment, or enthusiasm.”—I
was too sensible that there was but too
much truth in this gentleman’s observations,
though I could not assent to every
thing he said against our modern <i>virtuosi</i>,
among whom envy itself must acknowledge
there are some accomplished characters;
and the eighteenth century will
always glory in having produced an <span class="smcap">Elector
of Munich</span>, a <span class="smcap">Tenducci</span>, and a
<span class="smcap">Mus</span>.</p>

<p>“But,” said my friend, “perceiving
this to be the lamentable state of things,
I have with true and indefatigable industry
applied myself to the restoration
of the first <i>Adamitical</i> harmony; I have
selected the most admirable notes from
every animal, and have already acquired
a tolerable proficiency in bellowing,
braying and grunting: I indeed found
that the <i>squall</i> of the peacock was two
notes too high for my voice; but in re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>turn,
if I may say so without vanity, I
can inspire every hen and gosling in the
yard with tender sentiments. I have,
besides this, collected every great natural
genius that I have found among the
brute creation; I have a young he-ass
who has an admirable bass; a young
hog, (a <i>castrato</i>) who sings counter-tenor;
and a dear little cat, whom, in
honour of that illustrious name, so celebrated
in the Doctor’s tour, I call
<span class="smcap">Mingotti</span>, who has an excellent treble,
and a surprising <i>portamento</i>. But
why waste I time in description? you
shall see my scholars, and my <i>schola</i>.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he led me to a large building,
which resembled a barn, where we
were received by the <i>Maestro di Capella</i>,
who was an old and deaf huntsman. The
first object I beheld was a beautiful she-ass
in a <i>Mecklinburgh</i> night-cap, who
brayed a solo. Her voice was one of the
clearest, sweetest, truest, most powerful
and extensive I ever heard. In compass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
it is from <i>B♭</i> on the fifth space in the bass,
to <i>D</i> in <i>alt</i>, full steady and equal; her
shake was good, and her <i>portamento</i> admirably
free from the nose, mouth, or
throat. We were then entertained by a
duet between the <i>Mingotti</i>, and a large
raven, in the <i>chromatic</i>, which grew
more spirited by my friend’s pulling a
bone out of his pocket, which he threw
to the performers, and thereby produced
a <i>conflicta</i>. I then told my friend that I
would willingly hear the <i>castrato</i>, but he
told me he was afraid the <i>Caffarelli</i> could
not oblige me in that particular, as he had
unfortunately taken cold by rolling too
long upon an unaired dunghill, and was
then actually in a course of sugar-candy.
However, he threw a turnip to encourage
him to exert himself, and I could judge
from what I then heard, that he is likely
to become a most masterly performer.</p>

<p>My friend then tied strings to the ears
of six young greyhound puppies, which
he twitch’d with so much art and judgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
by means of a pully, that I think the
effect was equal to any <i>viol di gamba</i> I ever
heard, not excepting that of the Elector
of <i>Munich</i>.</p>

<p>My friend then suspended two cats by
the tails, which he contrived should alternately
bob upon the noses of two sucking
pigs, who were tied by the hind-legs
to the floor: though I observed these performers
were somewhat embarassed in
their manner, yet I could not but acknowledge
the effect was quite original
and truly theatric.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Quaver</i> then told me that he had
formerly introduced some of these performers
to sing at a concert, but without
success: and he made great complaints of
the unpoliteness of the audience, which
he said could sit with patience three hours
to listen to the unmeaning trills of heroes
in hoop-petticoats, and <i>Italian</i> vagabonds
in a strange language, while they would
not bestow one half hour upon the voice
of nature and their brethren. Tho’ I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
quite ignorant of the facts he alluded too,
yet, like Dr. <span class="smcap">Mus</span>, I was so partial to talents,
wherever I found them, that I
could not help condoling with my kind
host upon the occasion; and after having
bemoaned the degeneracy of the times,
and wished him success in his truly original
undertaking, which I promised him I
would take due notice of in my intended
work, I set forward on my journey to
<i>Bristol</i>.</p>

<p>Had I been rich, I should have agreed
with a coachman, who was just then
setting out, and offered to carry me and my
bassoon, in the basket, for sixteen shillings.
But as riches are not always the companions
of genius, I rather chose to take
my place in a coal-vessel, which was to
arrive at that city in three days. Here,
as the weather was extremely fine when I
sat out, I travelled very agreeably, for
the first day, and dined upon bread
and cheese, and cold bacon, without
making any observations worth commu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>nicating
to the public, except that I
saw a man standing upon the bank, and
angling for dace, notwithstanding the
earliness of the season.</p>

<p>The second day, as the wind suddenly
changed from West to North-East, was
foggy, rainy, and so exceedingly cold, that
I was obliged, for want of Dr. <span class="smcap">Mus</span>’s lousy
blanket, to slip my legs and thighs into a
coal-sack; we stopped about two o’clock
at <i>Averley</i>, a little village on the banks
of the <i>Severn</i> to dine; and here I cannot
but inform the world, that Mr. <i>Bangor</i>,
at the sign of the <i>Goat in Boots</i>, is an extremely
civil and polite landlord, and has
no contemptible taste in music. When I
informed him of my design in making this
expedition, he very obligingly led me into
his hall, which was stuck round with
various antique pieces of music, such as
<i>Chevy Chace</i>, <i>The Children in the Wood</i>,
<i>Three Children sliding on the Ice</i>, <i>The history of
St. George</i>, &amp;c. which he kindly permitted
me to enrich my collection with. I begged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
hard that he would permit me to prick
out the notes of an incomparable whistle
as he performed it, which at length with
great difficulty he complied with, upon
condition however that I should not print
it. But I was more than all surprized
and charmed with his generosity, in slipping
a piece of fried cow’s heel into my
pocket, and insisting upon treating me
with a dram, before I went into the cold.</p>

<p>As I walked down to the river side, I
remarked a boy, who was humming the
tune of <i>Yanky Doodle</i>; and as I knew this
to be an extremely popular air in some
parts of <i>America</i>, I conjectured that this
part of <i>England</i> was originally peopled
from that continent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BRISTOL">BRISTOL.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Late</span> the next evening, we arrived
at <i>Bristol</i>, a large and populous
city, more famous for its commerce,
manufactures and such trifles, than for
its taste in music. They have but lately
had a regular theatre established there to
civilize and polish the uncouth manners
of the dissenters, who would even have
succeeded in the savage opposition they
made to this salutary measure, if the
bishops had not espoused the cause of the
fine arts; I have little doubt, therefore,
that they will soon find that “music is so
combined with things sacred and important,
as well as with our pleasures,
that it seems necessary to our existence:”
they will then quickly become
friends to organs, and next to operas.
As I approached the city, I was gratified
with seeing the battalions of the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
militia, who made a most formidable appearance,
and marched in exact time to
the marrow-bones and cleavers, which
had an admirable effect and were extremely
animating. I put up at the
<i>Dog’s Head in the Porridge-Pot</i>, and
after powdering my wig with some
flour, clipping my beard with a pair of
scissars, and turning my shirt, I went to
wait on Signor <i>Manselli</i>, to whom I had
letters of recommendation. When I
had knocked at the door, and enquired
whether the Signor was within, I was
informed that he was, but that I could
not see him, as he was then busied in
performing his vocalities. This answer,
you may be sure, redoubled my curiosity,
and I replied, “if a poor, yet I trust,
not unknown musician, may be judged
worthy of being an unobserved spectator
of the Signor’s meditations, I promise
not to interrupt his reveries, and perhaps
the Signor himself will not be
displeased at your introducing to him a
<i>Collioni</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>When he learned that I was a musician,
he bowed respectfully, and desiring me to
pull off my shoes, as he did himself, he
led me to the Signor’s apartment. When
we came to the door, the servant desired
me to pull off my coat, waistcoat, and
wig, and creep through a hole, which he
shewed me at the bottom of the door, as
he assured me the Signor did not suffer
even crowned heads to approach him in
these moments of enthusiasm, without
taking those precautions; “and sir,” said he,
“you need not think this an humiliating
situation, as I have seen many persons of
the first fashion, among whom were
several pregnant ladies, submit to the
same ceremony.”</p>

<p>I did not hesitate a moment to comply
with the customary <i>etiquette</i>, but stripping
myself to the shirt, I crept into the
room with the same awful silence with
which the antient priests approached the
Tripod of their God. Having posted myself
behind a large screen, I beheld the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Signor extended on his belly, while two
young and beautiful ladies were gently
stroaking his back with the palms
of their hands. He lay for some minutes
pensive and silent, as if waiting
for the inspirations of the divinity. At
length, on a sudden, “his eyes were fixt,
his underlip fell, and drops of effervescence
distilled from his whole
countenance.” Immediately explosions
of the most musical intonation I had ever
heard, issued from behind, and enraptured
the whole company. After this, he successively
coughed, sneezed, hiccuped,
eructated, squeaked and whistled in the
most harmonious manner that can be
conceived. “Thank heaven,” cried the
Signor, “my powers of harmony are
yet undiminished: I shall still live to
bless the world, and polish this brutal
nation.” Saying this, he took up his
fiddle, and played a most divine solo. I
heard him for some time in silent ecstacy,
’till at length incapable of suppressing my
emotions any longer, I precipitated myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
into his arms, crying or rather blubbering
out in imitation of the great <i>Cassarelli</i>,
<i>Bravo! bravissimo! Manselli, è Collioni
che ti lo dice</i>. The Signor seemed
somewhat surprized at my abrupt introduction,
but at length, recollecting
himself, he received me with ineffable
politeness. The ladies at my appearance,
had shrieked, and left the room, which
in the first hurry of our embraces we had
not perceived. But presently the Signor,
glancing his eye downwards, recollected
himself, and said with some warmth and
emphasis, “O, fye, Signor <i>Collioni</i>, I
took it for granted you were one of
<span class="allsmcap">US</span>.” I blushed at the imputation, and
said, “I hoped this defect would not
lessen me in his esteem, as my country
was not yet sufficiently civilized to have
adopted the custom; and though some
of our prime nobility had the spirit and
taste to lead the way, yet in the gross
conceptions of the <i>English</i>, there was a
certain degree of ridicule annexed to it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
which deterred several men otherwise
of the most exquisite politeness from
submitting to it.” The Signor was kind
enough to admit my excuses, but lamented
this as the greatest obstacle to the
national advancement in the science of
music. However, he averred that several
<i>English</i> young noblemen of fortune had to
his knowledge undergone the operation
in <i>Italy</i>, “and though,” added he, “an
ordinary proficient may be exempted
from the practice, yet it is indispensibly
necessary for one who would fathom all
the mysteries of the art, and emulate the
illustrious names of <i>Senesino</i>, <i>Farinelli</i>,
<i>Tenducci</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>I confess I was much staggered at what
he said, more especially as I began to entertain
some doubts myself whether the
characters of a man and a musician were
at all compatible.</p>

<p>I hinted to him, that I had formerly
heard, that a certain great Personage,
<i>tàm Marti quàm Mercurio</i>, equally il<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>lustrious
for his martial and his musical
talents, had adopted the practice; but as
the Doctor had not recorded it in his tour
to <i>Potzdam</i>, I imagined the report was
without foundation.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said he, “depend upon it, tho’
the Doctor has indeed omitted this
circumstance in the admirable description
he gives of that hero, and Dilettante
practising his <i>solfeggi</i> at <i>Potzdam</i>,
yet he would never have been either the
monarch, or the flutist he is without it.
Do you think, added he, that illustrious
philosopher could amuse himself so calmly
in his closet with fugus and adagios,
while ten thousand <i>Polish</i> widows, and
orphans, were imprecating curses upon
the head of their unfeeling destroyer,
unless he had totally disengaged himself
from every incumbrance of his sex
and species?”</p>

<p>Here the entrance of the young ladies
interrupted any further conversation on the
subject. The eldest, his niece, who was called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
<i>Gluckinella Inglesina</i>, desired me to sing,
which I did in the softest and most unmanly
tone I could exert, that I might not again
offend. I asked her what her real opinion
of my voice was? she answered me with
the most perfect affability, that I acquitted
myself tolerably well <i>considering</i>; tho’
“she thought me too ambitious of displaying
my talent of working parts and
subjects, and added that my <i>cantilena</i>
was often rude.”</p>

<p>I took an opportunity when I was alone
with this young lady, to enquire if the
<i>castrati</i> were much in vogue at <i>Bristol</i>,
and if that operation could be so safely
attempted on elderly gentlemen; this
young lady smiled at my simplicity, and
assured me that the operation was safe and
easy, and not so painful as to acquire any
degree of resolution, and that the <i>castrati</i>
were the favourites of the ladies, both of
the married and unmarried. She advised
me by all means to undergo the operation
as the Doctor had done in <i>Italy</i>, tho’ his
excess of modesty prevented him from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
boasting of it in his excellent treatise.
She added, that she could not with safety
love me, unless I would submit to this for
her sake.</p>

<p>This declaration from a young lady for
whom I now perceived I had imbibed the
most ardent affection, gave me great uneasiness;
that affection however was purely
platonic and spiritual, for personal charms
she had no more to boast of, that ever I
discovered, than <i>Mingotti</i> herself. Besides
the disadvantage of a contortion in the
ogle, vulgarly called a squint of the eye,
and a very long red nose, she had a
mouth, which tho’ it opened from ear
to ear, discovered to the eye nothing
but the sad remains of a set of ebony teeth,
which more resembled the ruins of an old
cathedral, than the polished ivory which
adorns the comic mouth of the celebrated
Mrs. <i>Ab-ngt-n</i>. There was yet another
circumstance to disgust the sensualist, and
deter him from approaching this Syren
with an improper familiarity; and that
was the great offensiveness of her breath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
which was so violent, that any person not
“determined” like me “to hear, see,” and
smell “nothing but music,” might have
thought it hardly atoned for by the sweetness
of her voice. Yet none of these circumstances
damped the ardor of my spiritual
attachment, founded, as it was, upon
a solid basis, the love of song;—it
was embodied harmony, the tuneful
soul which I adored. The reader who
is unacquainted with the difference between
a gross sensual passion, and a
sublime, harmonic sympathy, may perhaps
be surprized when I tell him, that
while I was thus devoted to the divine
<i>Gluckinella</i>, I was at the same time personally
captivated by the corporeal attractions
of a little black-ey’d Gypsy, the wife of a
barber in the town, who often shaved
me for a tune; yet did not these grosser
feelings the least impair or abate my
musical platonic love. I might perhaps
be excused, were I to conceal the progress
and issue of these different amours; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
they are so intimately blended with the
scientific part of my work, and were attended
with such important consequences
to myself in my professional capacity,
that I doubt not the narration will prove of
great utility to my brethren. For it was no
common temptation that deluded me; tho’
Mrs. <i>Sharpset</i> was abundantly handsome,
I could have resisted “the blandishments
of beauty,” if a desire of making dangerous
experiments upon the power and effects of
music upon female passion had not seized
my brain. For I had taken notice, that
the imagination of this young woman
was exceedingly lively and far out-stripped
her husband’s, who was a plain dull man
with little fire or enthusiasm in his composition.
I plainly perceived this in all
her gestures and movements, but when I
sung some tender sentimental air, her involuntary
sighs, blushes, and languid attitude,
betrayed too plainly the irritability
of her nervs, and that fine susceptibility
of soft emotions with which nature has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
endowed the sex. No wonder that in a
rude, uncultivated state of nature as I then
was, I caught the subtle fire from her
contagious eyes. Ah! how often did I
sing the <i>sweet passion of Love</i> without
once thinking of my dear <i>Gluckinella</i>; how
often did she encore my <i>O how pleasing ’tis
to please</i>, without the slightest recollection
of her absent barber! Madly determined
to pursue the fatal experiment, and observe
the full effects of my art; I next
sung “<i>Haste, let us rove, to the Island of
Love”</i>, at which Mrs. <i>Sharpset</i> was
greatly agitated and danced about the
room. Then I played a rapturous voluntary
“produced in the happy moments of
effervescence when my reason was less
powerful than my feeling;” and at
length I proceeded to such excess of temerity,
as to tune up <i>Geho Dobbin</i>, <i>Murdoch
O’Blaney</i>, and several other inflammatory
compositions; and finding my
mistress “attentive, and in a disposition
to be pleased, I became animated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
that true pitch of enthusiasm, which
from the ardor of the fire within,
is communicated to others and sets all
around in a blaze, so that the contention
between the performer and
the hearer was only who should please
or who should applaud the most,
till at length, not contented with
shewing her approbation by coughing,
hemming, and blowing the nose” she
“expressed rapture in a manner peculiar
to herself, and seemed to agonize with
pleasure too great for the aching
sense!” for at length, overpowered by
my quirking and quavering, and transported
beyond all the bounds of prudence,
Mrs. <i>Sharpset</i> on a sudden leaped
into my arms, hung round my
neck, and devoured me with eager
kisses, such as I never tasted before
or since. What man, what unemasculated
god could have withstood such
potent snares? Ah! my serene <i>Gluckinella</i>
had’st thou been there, these tumults had
all subsided, the devil had not got intire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
possession of my mind, voice and instrument,
nor had I needed the painful operation
of the barber’s avenging steel to
bring my wandering spirits back to reason:—for
soon, and in the midst of our illicit
joys, the door of the chamber was forced
open, and in rushed Mr. <i>Sharpset</i>.—Discordant
oaths and curses, and the
look and voice of a Fury making an
incantation to awake the dead, bespoke
the injured husband, and scared us from
the bed. He retired a moment to
fetch the instrument of his revenge.
Mrs. <i>Sharpset</i> escaped, but in an instant
I saw him return whetting his
keenest razor; and concluding, that he
meant to cut my throat upon the spot,
I fell down at his feet and in an agony
of fear and penitence, roared out such a
<span class="smcap">Miserere</span>, as was never heard at the
Pope’s chapel in <i>Passion-week</i>. Alas!
how did I wish for the genius of a <i>Gluck</i>,
“to paint <i>my</i> difficult situation occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
by complicated misery, and the tempestuous
fury of unbridled passions!”
But <i>Allegri</i> himself, had he chanted his
own <span class="smcap">Miserere</span>, could not have moved the
shaver’s unrelenting soul, or soothed his
injured honour up in arms, and demanding
its victim! I tried a softer strain, and
sang in melting mood, “<i>Let not rage thy
Bosom firing, pity’s softer claim remove</i>,”
&amp;c. but it was all one: still strapped he his
inexorable razor, humming out a song
of <i>Bravura</i>, the subject of which was
the castration of the devil by a baker;
(which, by the bye, is a very curious story,
whose authenticity I must enquire into
farther at my leisure.) I immediately
augured my approaching destiny from the
burden of this song; and the <i>Cornuto</i>
presently gave me to understand that my
conjecture was well founded. Having
been till now in a cold-sweat, and corporal
fear of my life, I congratulated myself on
this exchange of punishment, as a sort of
reprieve, and considering that I had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
time since resolved, like another <i>Grassetto</i>,
to undergo the operation whenever I found
myself bold enough for such a voluntary
sacrifice; I plucked up courage, and with
great composure told the barber, that a
guilty conscience was a greater torment to
me than any he could devise; but that to
expiate the crime I had committed, and appease
the anger of heaven, and the honest
man whom I had so deeply offended, I
would patiently submit to suffer the
righteous sentence which his vengeance
meditated on the peccant part. The
enraged tonsor took me at my word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first thing that came into my thoughts
after I awoke from the fainting fit, into
which the paroxism of pain had thrown
me, was to try my voice in its improved
state. I accordingly sung <i>A Dawn of
Hope my Soul revives</i>, and found my
powers wonderfully improved, and my
execution delicate, interesting, and full
of effects. “Ho, ho,” cries the barber, “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
am glad to find you are so merry,” and
resumed his old tune of the baker and the
devil. I told him I thought it unkind in
him to insult me, and intreated him
to convey me home, which he very readily
consented to do, and soon afterwards began
to apologize for the effects of his
rage, hoping I would consider the nature
of the provocation, and not attempt to
take the law of him. I answered, that
upon condition he would freely pardon
his wife, whose fault was venial, as her
virtue had fallen a sacrifice to the power
of harmony, I would decline any hostile
proceedings against him on my own account,
with which condition he appeared
satisfied, and we parted.—I was brought
home on a mule, on which I rode sideways;
and as soon as I alighted at Signor
<i>Manselli</i>’s I sent for him into my chamber,
and accosted him as he approached with
the following air, in singing which I
exerted all my newly-acquired powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>During my performance, the Signor appeared
perfectly astonished, and at length
seizing my hand with rapture, “welcome,”
he cried, “O son of harmony! it cannot
be longer disguised, you are a brother—you
are one of us”—then expatiating
on the dignity and importance of the
order of <i>castrati</i>, he desired me, if not
too much exhausted, to sing again his
favourite air, which when I had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
he cried out with transport;—“<i>nec vox
hominem sonat!</i> I can hardly believe
it is the same pipe! such a volume of
voice, such an open and perfect shake!
such light and shade! never was voice
less <i>cloudy</i>! such clearness, brilliancy,
neatness, expression, embellishment, intonation,
firmness, modulation, smoothness
and elegance! and then your <i>portamento</i>
is as round and tight as a
portmanteau, and you take <i>appogiatura</i>,
as easily as a body would take a pinch
of snuff!”—</p>

<p>I was greatly flattered by these encomiums,
but begged he would forbear
and suffer me to retire to my chamber,
for the sake of necessary refreshment and
rest. He immediately complied, and sent up
to me Signor <i>Sougelder</i>, an eminent surgeon
in the neighbourhood, and an agreeable
performer on the <i>English</i> horn; who
having applied an excellent dressing to
my wound left me to sleep, and “thus
ended this busy and important day, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
which so much was said, and done;
that it seemed to contain the events of a
much longer period; and I could hardly
persuade myself, upon recollecting the
several incidents, that they had all happened
in about the space of twelve
hours.” By the kind and skilful offices
of Signor <i>Sougelder</i>, I was soon restored to
my health and spirits; and my adorable
Signora <i>Gluckinelli</i> in a few days paid me
a visit of congratulation, which she repeated
every day during my recovery. It
was in some of these delightful interviews
I discovered how deep a theorist she
was, and how learned in the science of
sound. Among other discoveries and
observations which she communicated to
me, and which I treasure up, and mean
to preserve for the benefit of future ages,
she assured me that it was “practicable
with time and patience to give a shake
where nature has denied it; that she
thought, the shake ruined ninety-nine
times out of a hundred by too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
impatience and precipitation, both in
the master and scholar, and that many
who can execute passages which require
the same motion of the <i>larynx</i> as the shake,
have notwithstanding never acquired
one”—“There is no accounting for
this,” added that illustrious young lady,
with a sigh, “but from the neglect of
the master to study nature, and avail
himself of these passages, which by
continuity would become real shakes.”</p>

<p>During my confinement to my chamber,
I have had leisure to extract the
foregoing observations, anecdotes, and
adventures from my journal, and which
I present to the world as the first hints of
my undertaking. If they tend in any
shape to promote the study and practice
of music in this country, and by
that means lessen our national reproach
of being <i>The Savages of Europe</i>, immersed
in politics, philosophy, metaphysics, mathematics,
and other sour and abstruse
speculations, I shall have gained my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
end, and shall congratulate myself on
having in some humble degree assisted the
generous efforts of the great musical
Doctor, and the governors of the <i>Foundling
Hospital</i>, to polish and <i>Italianize</i> the
genius, taste, and manners of the <i>English</i>
nation.</p>

<p>I shall trespass on the reader’s patience
but one moment longer, to inform him
that as soon as I had perfectly recovered my
health, Signor <i>Manselli</i> instituted a grand
<i>Fête Cbampêtre</i> to celebrate what he was
pleased to call my victory over the flesh
and the devil; and to crown the whole,
the idol of my soul, the fair <i>Gluckinella</i>,
was that day pleased to condescend publicly
to avow her platonic harmonic passion
for me; and to promise me in the most
endearing manner, that if ever she entered
into the holy slate of matrimony, I should
be her <span class="smcap">Cecisbeo</span>.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
